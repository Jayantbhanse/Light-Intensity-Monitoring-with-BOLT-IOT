# Light-Intensity-Monitoring-with-BOLT-IOT
monitoring the intensity of light with bolt iot and displaying it on a webpage with graph

This is the first project I build while learning IOT on Internshala and it was quite amazing, got my hands on bolt iot and bolt cloud and Bolt for a fact is quite good as a platform, lets dive into the project now.

Light Intensity Monitoring System

So as the project name suggest we are going to build a system that will measure the intensity of light.

We made this project to check on whether the plants are getting adequate sunlight or not.

We all know that plants require sunlight for their healthy growth. However, at times we may not be able to keep a track of it or maybe we are not sure if our plants are getting enough sunlight.

To Build this project please read DIY file.
